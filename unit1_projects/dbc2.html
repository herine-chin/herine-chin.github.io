	<h2>Introduction...</h2>
	<p>Teaching your pup to sit is one of the most important tricks you could ever teach. It's part obedience training and part bonding. Wouldn't it be easier to put a collar on your furbaby while they are sitting rather than walking around? How about sitting when a child wants to pet them?</p>

	<h2>What you'll need...</h2>
	<ul><div class="lists">
		<li>Clicker (pictured)</li>
		<li>Treats (Yummy and bite-sized)</li>
		<li>Time (15-30 minutes)</li>
		<li>Space (5'x5' minimum)</li>

	<h2>Philosophy...</h2>
	<p>Approach each pup with love and they will love you back for it. When teaching a trick, I like to use <span id="philosophy">positive reinforcement</span>. You are basically rewarding your pup when they do something right.</p>

<section class="container">
	<h2>Clicker technique...</h2>
	<p>Before we teach the actual trick, we have to acclimate your puppy to the clicker. A pup can be confused with the multiple verbal praises given during training. The clicker provides a <span id="signal">clear signal</span> that something was done right so the pup can start associating their behavior to what you want.</p>
	<ol><div class="lists">
		<li>Click your clicker.</li>
		<li>If your pup looks at you, immediately reward them with a treat. If they do not, repeat step 1 until they do.</li>
	</div>
	</ol>
</section>
<section class="container">
	<h2>The tricky part...(not really)</h2>
	<ol><div class="lists">
		<li>Stand in front of your pup with treat and clicker in hand.</li>
		<li>Hold the treat in front of your pup's nose and slightly above their head. The pup will naturally lean back and sit. Adjust your hand if necessary.</li>
		<li>Say "Sit" when they do.</li>
		<li>Click and reward with a treat!</li>
		<li>Repeat 5-10 times</li>
		<li>Practice daily and slowly move your further away with each session. Eventually your pup will sit on command instead of following your hand.</li>
