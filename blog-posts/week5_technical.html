			<h3>A short class about class.</h3>	
			<p class="text">Ruby is an object oriented language and a class is like the blueprint for objects when they are created. Take a look at the class example image. I have a thing for snakes! (Insert python language joke.) Here we've created a class for pet snakes. The class stores characteristics, our example has name and length, of our pet snake. The class can also hold functions or instance methods that can be used on objects of that class. In the example, you can feed your pet snake a rat, mice or pet it. Each does something different. <br><br>Now lets get a little more technical. When a new snake is created, like Noodles and Monty, with the .new method, the initialize method automatically stores the name and length in instance variables, they have @ in front. Instance variables allow other class methods to use that data. As you can see, the instance variable @name is used in all three class methods. What this means is that each of your pet snakes will have an output specific to them even though the same method is called on them. Pretty spiffy right? </p>
