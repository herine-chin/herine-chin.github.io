			<h3>Asian female drivers</h3>	
			<p class="text">When I hear people make jokes about Asian female drivers, I laugh! Maybe I shouldn't but I can't help conjure up experiences of my own with such drivers in Chinatown. Then I look in the mirror and go... oh wait...<br><br>My driving record is unblemished. I've never been involved in an accident or had a moving violation.  You can say "Oh it's because you probably drive like a granny" but in fact I'm quite the opposite.  I have moderate road rage; I speed (carefully ;P) and can out maneuver most of my male friends on the track (on a go kart!). Stereotype fail! I think it's why it takes me a second to realize I am part of that demographic but when I'm reminded, I find myself treading lightly as to not conform to it.  Growing up in the diverse Bay Area, I knew stereotypes were really vague generalizations that don't apply to everyone. There were plenty of "dumb" Asians at the schools I've attended. On occasion, stereotype jokes popped up but were usually committed by a member of the affected group! I know, I've used the Asian female driver reference myself a few times to excuse myself from a less than stellar driving moment. However, as I have gotten older, I am reminded more and more about these stereotypes and have grown more self conscious about it. What was taken lightheartedly as a kid is now propagated in the news as controversy or issues.</p>

			<h3>I don't like it.</h3>
			<p class="text">Stereotype threat has been shown to reduce the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups. It makes them anxious and hinders their ability to perform at their best. Dr. Claude Steel has done numerous experiments and published studies in regards to this. Personally, I feel most affected by gender stereotypes in regards to my pursuit of programming. I wasn't really aware of them until I started down this path. I find myself occasionally doubting my mathematical abilities even though I was a mathlete in my youth, competed in high school math clubs and took calculus 3 for fun in college. With the release of company demographic reports, such as the one by <a href="week4_cultural.html">Google</a>, it was an "in your face" kind of realization that I have a lot of obstacles ahead of me, including myself. I don't like it. I don't like doubting myself. I've always told myself that I can do anything if I put my mind to it.</p>

			<h3>Game on</h3>
			<p class="text">I feel as if I was sheltered in regards to this as a kid or maybe I had a coping mechanism that I was unaware of? I think I just didn't care. Girls don't play sports but I was co captain of my high school varsity swim team. Girls don't play video games but I've had at least one gaming system ready to go at any given moment since I was 5. Thank you dad for the original NES!  Is not caring a real solution?...Probably not for the masses. Stereotype threat is real and needs to be addressed but I wish people would just change the language or approach to addressing it. Stop pointing at the wound and focus on the healing. It's hard for me to come up with a specific solution. There are too many things to factor in as there are many stereotypes and it's a bit utopian to suggest everyone just stop using stereotypes.</p>
