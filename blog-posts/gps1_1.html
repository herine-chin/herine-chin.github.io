        <div class="container">
            <p><em>Pair programming</em> is an increasingly popular technique wherein two programmers work together on one workstation. The <em>Driver</em> actively writes code while the <em>Navigator</em> directs the Driver and/or reviews the code. Pair programming is part of the <em>Agile Software Development</em> strategy (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile what?</a>) and is becoming a standard method of software development.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>According to Wikipedia, pairs spend 15% more time on programs than individuals with 15% fewer defects in the final programs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">More study reviews</a>). Catching errors while they happen not only saves time but also saves money.</li>
                    <li>Pairs can learn strategies and techniques from each other. Each person brings different skills and knowledge to the team.</li>
                    <li>Better strategies are developed with immediate peer review.</li>
                    <li>It is more enjoyable than working alone and increases confidence in the quality of the final product.</li>
                    <li>If pair programming occurs with other members of the development team it helps to build communication skills and camaraderie. Also, all members of the team feel more included in the project and feel a greater amount of responsibility for the project's success.</li>

            <p>REFLECT! No, not what your mirror does but what every pair should do at the end of a session. It helps to clarify and solidify new concepts. This webpage was the product of a paired programming session.</p>

                        <p>I must say my first guided pairing session wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was afraid I wouldn't know what to do or do the opposite and be too pushy with my ideas. I think I found a happy medium. I enjoyed pairing with Matti, he was great with helping to generate ideas and content for this webpage. I was the main driver and I did have to look up a few syntaxes but for the most part it wasn't completely foreign for me. All those late night studying seem to be paying off!  I made sure that I talked outloud, explained everything about what and I was typing. One of the biggest things that "clicked" for me was how to read the css on the chrome dev tools. I couldn't understand why there were certain styles crossed off when there were lots of embedded elements before. Now I can see which one are affecting the element and which ones don't. I can now figure out why my previous edits weren't working the way I intended them to. I think overcommunicating really worked well. What didn't work? Stypi... and I'm not sure how to time manage open ended projects like these. We took more than the hour we had with our guide and spent another few hours after putting everything togther.</p>
