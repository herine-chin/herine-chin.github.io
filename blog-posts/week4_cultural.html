			<h3>The issue...</h3>	
			<p class="text">Google recently released a diversity report of their workforce in May and it set off a flurry of gender inequality discussions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women total 47 percent of the work force. It's obvious when comparing the two reports that there's a male dominance in the tech industry. This dominance has perpetuated a brogrammer culture that at times is offensive to the opposite sex. Examples of this would be the titstare app and Microsoft's Xbox One rape joke. From my own experiences, I've come across sites, such as <a href="https://codebabes.com/">codebabes.com</a>, which clearly caters to men.<br><br>This culture compounded with the already low number of women entering the tech industry is creating a vicious cycle. According to the National Center for Women and information Technology, only 18 percent of computer-science college graduates were women. In a study conducted by the Harvard Business School, the attrition rate of women leaving the field is double that of men. It's understandable that female engineers would feel "pushed away."

			<h3>What next?</h3>
			<p class="text">Increased diversity, from a business standpoint, relate to better outcomes such as increased innovation and profitability. Google's senior vice president of people operations pointed out findings from two studies on gender inequality in schools and business. One was that "girls don't raise their hands as often as boys when answering math problems, even though they have higher rate of accuracy when they do." The other was that "women don't offer up their ideas as often as men in business meetings, even though observers say their thoughts are often better than the many offered by their male colleagues." Imagine how not only increasing the number of women but also helping them speak up would benefit the tech industry.<br><br>There are plenty of suggestions on how to reverse the inequality ranging from better K-9 curriculum to peak young girl's interests and female oriented groups such as <a href="http://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>. I feel that awareness is key to changing the gender demographic and finding more data to realize the whys. Google has started by releasing their report. Hopefully other companies follow suit to expose the issue. The more we talk about it, the more it IS an issue which then leads to more solutions.</p>
