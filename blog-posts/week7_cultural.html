			<h3>Important Values</h3>	
			<p class="text">When I think of times in my life that I've been proudest, these are the values that come to mind.<br><br>Accomplishment, Challenge, Control, Creativity, Credibility, Effectiveness, Growth and Will-power. <br><br>Creativity is one of the most important values to me because it's a way for me to express myself without being overt. It's my approach to any solution when there are enough parts and an appropriate amount of time to tackle it. How creative can I get? For me, Creativity is tied to Challenge, Control and Effectiveness.<br><br>In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>Disagree(1) ... Agree(5)<br>Accomplishment ~ 4<br>Challenge ~ 4<br>Control ~ 4<br>Creativity ~ 5<br>Credibility ~ 4<br>Effectiveness ~ 4<br>Growth ~ 4<br>Will-power ~ 4</p>

			<h3>Advice</h3>
			<p class="text">The last time someone asked for my advice, they were asking about the stuff to consider when going back to school. In her situation, she wanted to quit her part-time job and focus purely on getting her degree. Other things to note is that her current work hours at are low and requires an hour or two of commute per day with bride tolls along the way. I suggested to her, let the numbers tell you what you need to know. Figure out your monthly expenses, such as car insurance, gas, food, health insurance, bills, etc and compare it to your current savings. Will it last throughout the duration of school? Turns out it wouldn't. That's when we dove in and started to break it down more. Where can expenses be cut? What if she found a local job that would allow her to continue receiving income and allow more time to study? After factoring the cost of gas and bridge tolls, it was a consensus that quitting her current job for another local job would be the most beneficial for her.</p>

			<h3>Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p class="text">I feel the values I hold dear can and have helped me mediate through stereotype threats. I see stereotype threats as a Challenge that I can overcome which leads to a sense of Growth and Accomplishment. Sometimes, when it gets a litte tough, I can push through with Will-power and Control what I can. </p>
