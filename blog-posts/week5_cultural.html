			<h3>Pair Pairing</h3>	
			<p class="text"> Peer Pairing is like going on a blind date. How much do you reveal? What if you say the wrong thing? What if they don't like you? What if your pairing styles don't jive? You have to solve something together AND you get some sort of "report card" after? Oh the pressure! At least you're not looking for forever. ;)<br><br>I've had many pairing sessions in the last few weeks and I have had the same concerns each time. It's become a sort of ritual to ponder every one of these questions 5 minutes before a session. And each time the sessions turn out great. I think everyone is sort of on the same boat right now, still unsure what the boundaries are with pairing. As such, everyone is exceptionally cordial. It also helps that the challenges haven't been that difficult to bring out the "worst" in each of us. With each of these pairings I've learned LOTS of new tips and ideas. There were many moments of celebration, internet high-fives and definitely moments where our hands are glued to our foreheads in frustration. I'm a natural problem solver and the solution alone is a great reward but being able to share that joy is like cream on top. We came, we saw, we conquered! </p>

			<h3>Feedback</h3>
			<p class="text">What happens after this blind date? We provide feedback. At times this is done with the partner in crime after a session and sometimes it's anonymous. Now, you can't just write anything. It should be kind, actionable and specific.<br><br>Kind: This isn't being nice. It's presenting your feedback in a non-offensive manner. There's no name calling or accusations. Using "I" statements are the best way to keep feedback kind.<br><br>Bad: You are pushy.<br>Good: I feel that my ideas were not considered.<br><br>Actionable: What's the point of a critique if you can't act upon it? Actionable feedback is worded so that the receiver can actually do something about it.<br><br>Bad: I don't like how you explain things.<br>Good: I found myself confused with your explanations because you use terms interchangeably. It would be great if you could stick to one term.<br><br>Specific: Being specific helps to illustrate your critique. It's not describing every detail of a situation but highlights. Adding context like what was going on and the approach is very useful.<br><br>Bad: I like it when you ask questions.<br>Good: The questions you asked helped to point out the problem. When we were stuck on which loop method to use, you asked if looping was even the right solution and turns out it wasn't.<br><br>I've written several feedback and seem to be having a hard time coming up with stuff at times. For the most part, I'm tied up on the excitement of surviving one! I've also noticed that the feedback I've received has been pretty easy going. Like I said before I think this is due to the level of our challenges. There isn't much to work on yet. At my previous company, who specializes in 360-degree feedback, I've had lots of practice receiving feedback. At first, you are Shocked/Surprised, then you may be Angry/Anxious, then Rejection/Rationalizing and eventually Acceptance. This is called the SARA cycle. I've enjoyed every one of my pairing sessions so far. </p>
