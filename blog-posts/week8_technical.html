			<h3>What is it?</h3>	
			<p class="text">I was exposed to recursion in my very first interview with DBC interview. A bit of code popped on my screen and it was a method with the same method inside. Whoa. I tried my best to describe it and I think I said it was loop of some sort. Wikipeda defines recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Another way to describe it is the divide and conquer mentality. You take the original problem, divide it into smaller instances of itself, solve them and reassemble the small pieces into a final solution. This can be used to solve something as simple as a factorial problem or as complicated, complicated to me, as a minesweeper game. I was fascinated with recursion so I decided to blog about it.</p>

			<h3>Why use it?</h3>
			<p class="text">I wanted to use recursion to solve everything because it seems so cool but I know that it's not the most feasible solution for most coding problems. Did I mention how cool it looks? My biggest worry was about when to use it. Why would we want to use recursion instead a loop? A loop is so much easier to understand. My research on the topic narrowed it down to this...<br>
			Recursion usually doesn't make your code faster nor does it usually take less memory but it does make your code much simpler!<br><br>
			Here are two rules to remember about recursion.<br><br>
			1. Every recursive needs to have base case, the condition under which no recursive call is made, in order to prevent infinite recursion. Translation: Let's not crash the program.<br>
			2. Adding to the previous, each recursive method must make progress towards the base case to once again prevent infinite recursion.
