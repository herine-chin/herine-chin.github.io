			<h3>Emotional Conflict</h3>	
			<p class="text">We deal with emotional conflict regularly. Lately, for me, it feels hourly if not daily. Time has become precious and everything seems to be fighting for priority. I'm part of two weddings at the moment with my DBC right in between both. The first wedding is the day before starting my cohorot. Where's the emotional conflict? When the bride is horrible with logistics and is inconsiderate of your time. I know it's their big day but when you've made every effort to work with them, notify them of your availability to do things since they can't seem to tell you when they need help AND tried to be pre-emptive, emotions will run high. Last week, I helped alter one of the bride's dress and we had discussed previously that there would be no bustling needed since she had a second dress to change into. For all the guys and gals out there reading this and are unfamiliar with what a bustle is, it's just a pretty way of scrunching up excess dress material so it's not in the way. Well, right after putting the finishing touches on her dress, she decided that she had gained too much weight for the second dress and asked to bustle the first in an insistent manner. Please note this is a week and a half before the wedding and she had NOT mention the thought of bustling at all. It was obvious that she thought of her request as minor and easy to do. My first reaction was to verbally attack her (compass of shame), which I didn't but really wanted to. I wanted to grill her into why she didn't say anything sooner, why was this so last minute, doesn't she know I have no time, how can she be so inconsiderate?  It quickly changed to attacking myself. Why did I agree to this chaos?! Sigh. I didn't say a word but I know I gave her a funny face which ended the conversation abruptly. I think she could tell there was a bit of anger in my eyes. Did my reaction make it better or worse? Probably worse. She avoided me for a few days after this. This perpetuated my self attack. I felt bad that I felt angry. After, I let my frustrations dissipate, I went looking for another second dress for her instead.</p>

			<h3>What if?</h3>
			<p class="text">If I could go back, I think I would have tried to say what I was thinking but in a more diplomatic manner. I feel that by voicing it, it would have provided the feedback she needed to stop or at least lessen her tendency to be so inconsiderate of my time. It also would have allowed me to let go of my pent up frustrations/anger quicker so it wasn't eating me up inside. If I could go further back, I think I would have not agreed to be part of her wedding party. I know this is hindsight but I should have put my own life plan priorities much higher and lessen my involvement in hers. </p>
