			<p class="text">It was like trying to drink from a hydrant! I ran through every emotion possible from being on the verge of tears to crying for joy. I cursed at DBC a few times and I also surprised myself along the way.<br><br>After watching Shareef's Fireside chat, I must admit a part of me was expecting DBC to be a nice neat package. It's definitely an experiment in progress. I couldn't help but nitpick at bits of my DBC experience that I felt could be better. Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting perfection at all but I did find myself getting frustrated with how some of the information was presented that caused me to go on mini wild goose chases for the answer.  Time that I wanted to spend learning!<br><br> However, I have no regrets but I do have the fear, yes the fear. The one that rhythmically repeats in the back of my mind... "you suck at this." And I am so glad that it's a somewhat normal fear. Now I know and now I can overcome. With that all said, I survived week 1, in fact it lit a match under my buttocks, and now I am better prep for week 2. Bring it.</p>
