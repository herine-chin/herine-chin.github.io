			<h3>That's me!</h3>	
			<p class="text">As for thinking style, that's a bit more complicated. When I first took the personal thinking style quiz, I was predominantly Abstract Sequential with Concrete Random following somewhat close. I took it again to prep for this blog and once again, I'm Abstract Sequential but now Concrete Random and Concrete Sequential are following close. What does that mean?! I started researching what each style meant and noticed that I could be put into any of those three buckets, show them to someone and they would go "Yup! That's 90% you." I actually did do that. Now to add a little more "hmmmm that's interesting" factor, I consulted with an I/O Psychologist to help me understand if this test is valid, turns out, it wouldn't pass today's standard of measurement. One thing is for sure, which helps validate the test, I'm definitely not much of a Abstract Random kind of gal!</p>

			<h3>Now what?</h3>
			<p class="text">The purpose of this blog is to understand my strengths, weaknesses and preferences in learning. I'll still going to address it. I'll just have to cherry pick a litle from each of the styles for a "custom" profile.<br><br>
				I like...<br>
				order, logical sequences, predictability, getting facts, my point to be heard, analyze situations before making a decision or acting, applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems, experiment to find answers, use my intuition, and solve problems independently.<br><br>I know, I know, some of you may read "analyze situations before making a decsion" with "experiment to find answers" as conflicting but it really isn't. I could technically analyze a situation and find it appropriate to experiment for answers!<br><br>
				I learn best when...<br>in a structured environment, faced with predictable situations, can apply ideas in pragmatic ways, have access to experts or references, placed in stimulating environments, able to work alone, they are able to use trial and error approaches, able to compete with others, and given the opportunity to work through the problems by myself.<br><br>
				I find it hard to...<br>work in groups, discussions that seem to have no specific point, work in an unorganized enviroment, follow incomplete or unclear directions, work with unpredictable people, being forced to work with those of differing views(sorta), too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, repeating the same tasks over and over, lots of specific rules and regulations, "sentimental" thinking, expressing their emotions, being diplomatic when convincing others, not monopolizing a conversation, restrictions and limitations, formal reports, routines, re-doing anything once it's done, keeping detailed records, showing how I got the answer, choosing only one answer (case & point, this post!), and having no options. </p>

			<h3>What next?</h3>
			<p class="text">A little backstory here, I used to work for a consulting firm that dealt with lots of hiring practices, 360-degree feedback and behavior analysis. I've taken more personality tests than I can remember and am pretty aware of my own learning preferences. Now how to cater myself to DBC's teaching style? In general I tend to make order out of the chaos were I can. At the beginning of Phase 0, I put together a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz3Vgnkr-uyDcVhfWEh2T1NyTEEzZHVQeWdoZlNrR19yc21V/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> just to keep track of everything that was required. It helped to alleviate a lot of the stress of learning so many new things at once. Where I can't apply order, I'll experiment until I find a solution that best fits. That's been my approach so far with numerous challenges. Being adaptive and flexible with strong problem-solving skills has served me well in many environments. I know I will run into pain points at DBC but it's being aware of it that makes me go "well I can't change what's happening so I'll change what I can do."  And the real struggle is stopping myself from making things perfect. There goes that "p" word. This blog post is a clear example of how I had attempted to make it the "p" word. I found new information in my research which I then digressed to truly understand what I'm researching and now to relaying what I've found with as much of my thoughts as possible. I could have kept it short and sweet but it's my blog and I write what I want to! My point must be heard! That must be the abstract sequential side of me talking. ;P </p>
