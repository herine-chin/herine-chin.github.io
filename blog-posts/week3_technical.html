			<h3>Pros</h3>
			<p id="jsexample" class="text">Javascript is gaining lots of popularity for several important reasons. It works on practically all devices and browsers which reduces the amount of work programmers need to do. Imagine having to build a tool once versus one for each type of device. That's more efficient right? It's pretty easy to learn. It runs on the client side which saves on bandwith and reduces loads on servers. What does that mean for a user? It means speedier pages. You don't need a special computer program to run it, just a good ole plain text editor and a browser. Above all, the amount of resources available is mind blowing. There are lots of libraries like JQuery where you can grab code from instead of having to reinvent the wheel. With the addition of node, JS also allows a programmer to work on the backend. How cool is that? </p>

			<h3>Cons</h3>
			<p class="text">As amazing as JS is, there are some pitfalls to discuss. It's reliant on browsers and therefore has limitations based on them. There are numerous browsers available to users and each has a different JS engine. That means JS code might be interpreted differently from one to another. A programmer can keep descrepancies as a minimum by testing on all major browsers. Speaking of users earlier, did you know that some speakers turn off JS? Yes, JS can be disabled. A JS heavy website might just be inoperable if that happens. One of the reasons why users disable it is because there are possible security issues. How? Third party hackers can inject JS into your site and control what the users do.</p>
