			<h3>Questions</h3>	
			<p class="text">I was always told there's no such thing as a stupid question only stupid answers but I never really believed it. There have been many instances when I read forum questions and was really confused by what they were asking or by the sheer lack of research before posing the question. Asking questions is a great way to learn but to get the good answers, you have to ask good questions. Here are a few pointers.</p>

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p class="text">Before you start writing your question, do a little research. It's amazing how quickly you can find your answer before asking others for help. If you can access the internet to post a question on a forum, you can also google to find out what you want to know first. I have always had a pet peeve of seeing posted questions with answers that are easily accessible and I know they are because I've probably had the same ones and googled it myself! It gives me the impression that the poster is lazy. </p>

			<h3>Title and Content</h3>
			<p class="text">Now that you've done your research and are still stuck. It's time to post the question. The best approach is to imagine that you're trying to answer it. What information or type of information would you need? Let'st start with the title. It's best to ask a question that's specific and direct. By asking a question in the title. It makes it interesting and more likely to be read.<br>
			Bad: Ruby string question<br>
			Better:  Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?<br><br>
			Moving onto the body. Expand on the title and what you've done or researched before posing snippets of code. This helps with the context of the question. People won't kow the best way to "skin the cat" if they don't even know what tools you have. Make sure your introduction is clear. Remember that part about imagining yourself trying to answer it?<br><br>
			When posting sample code, don't post every line but the ones that pertain to your question. Make sure to include parts such as defined variables so that a reader can quickly reference it without asking what it is.</p>

			<h3>Formatting</h3>
			<p class="text">After you've written your question, it's a good idea to go over it not just for grammar and proofreadig but also format. The format will make it easier for reader to follow complicated steps or descriptions and especially complicated code. Code should obviously look like code and not a paragraph. Long paragraphs should be broken down to smaller ones. </p>
